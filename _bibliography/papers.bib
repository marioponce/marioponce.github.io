  abstract={Smallholder farmers are critical to global food production and natural resource management. Due to increased competition for water resources and variability in rainfall due to climate change, chronic irrigation water scarcity is rising particularly in drought-prone regions. Improving the awareness of climatic risk to yields and incomes is critical to sustainable agricultural intensification. However, adopting a new technology represents a certain level of risk for the farmers, who invest time and economic resources in changing their practices. We have developed an application (app), currently for cotton, that would allow farmers to actualize the risk of growing cotton. By implementing a sociohydrological dynamic model with a kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) structural error model, the software provides a risk forecast of the yield and profit the user can expect at the end of the season. The app not only processes social and agricultural information provided by the user but also retrieves and continually updates climate datasets from the web, as well as market prices. The users can request the execution of the sociohydrological model to the servers from their own mobile devices. By following an agile methodology, the mobile app has been tested with ~100 farmers in order to get feedback from real users; this brought the opportunity to redesign the functionality based on the correct understanding of information and, a fast and clear management of the tool and helping in the adoption of the technology. This was combined with existing knowledge around communicating risk by using multiple modes of communication - text, graphics, sound and video - all of which were implemented to reinforce the knowledge communicated and ensure sufficient redundancy. This turned out to be beneficial for farmers with low prior knowledge and higher acceptability of the app by the users as evidenced through feedback rounds with them. This study exemplifies an approach to address the gap in communicating risks in agriculture using a user-friendly mobile application.},

  title={Participatory development of mobile agricultural advisory driven by behavioural determinants of adoption},

  abstract={Mobile applications have the potential to revolutionise agricultural advisories, providing farmers with real-time information and insights for improved decision-making. However, the adoption of such apps is influenced by various behavioural factors, necessitating a participatory approach of development with the stakeholders. The Theory of Change (ToC) approach is used to develop a digital survey to determine major socio-economic and behavioural factors driving and hindering agricultural mobile advisory adoption. Linear regression models based on data collected from 1200 farmers conducted in Maharashtra (India) during April-May 2023 were used to determine these significant factors. Using this as a basis, multiple in-person and online feedback sessions were undertaken with farmers from the same region (from March 2023 to January 2024), iteratively working on developing different features of a risk advisory app. The surveys on behavioural determinants emphasised the influence of norms, trust, abilities, and attitudes in app adoption. The app's development process enriched the participatory design by focusing on such behavioural aspects, integrating features such as multi-lingual support, intercropping and multi-cropping options, and multi-component budgeting to enhance trust and ability to use. Frontend features were similarly transformed to enhance user-friendliness and incorporate redundancy (e.g., text and audio-visual communication) in communicating risk. Overall, the paper presents a mixed methods approach of assessing behavioural drivers of agricultural technologies in context of agricultural apps to motivate a participatory co-design approach and enabling considerations for inclusivity and scaling in the design process of the app itself. },
