# M.A. Ponce Pacheco

Hoi. This is Mario (*A.K.A. Pacheco*). I have specialised in creating innovative solutions for environmental data analysis. My work focuses on tools that help us better explore and understand phenomena related to Hydrology and Climate Change.

About me ... amateur cyclist and rugger, former american football player ... maths lover and programming enthusiast ... I'm just a dreamer...
